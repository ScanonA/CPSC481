Important Consequences:
 A theorem is in Beta noromal form if the one who beta ductions leaving true team 
 i.e     t is beta-nf <==> there is no element t --> t'
                                                   beta

 *************    if t1 and t2 are beta normal form terms then one sequence =beta iff they are al
 pha equivalent
 
 Proof: Suppose t1 =beta t2(s) then this means true are a series of terms =beta steps union
 can be viewd as beta reductions

Examples of terms in normal form (n.f)
 *every variable is in n.f 
 *any term with no lambda-constructions is in normal form 
 *any n.f term can be labmda-constructed and will be in normal form 
    lambayx. xyz lambdax . xx
	
Why is this important? This shows that lambda-calculus is consistent, i.e. not everything
is equal.

Corollary: EVery term isin the lamba-calculus beta-reduces to at most one normal form

Example: Omega = (lambdax . xx) (lambdax . xx) has no n.f, it beta reduces to itself

/*********************AFTER PROOF PICTURES FOUND IN FOLDER


Now consider the case when the many reduction is not a true root.
We show true manner beta reduction as a reduicion in a one hole context
